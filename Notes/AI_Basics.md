# Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its Components

---

## 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is the science of making machines mimic human intelligence, including reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

**Subsets of AI:**

* **Machine Learning (ML)**: Systems that learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
* **Deep Learning (DL)**: A specialized branch of ML using neural networks to model complex patterns.
* **Generative AI (GenAI)**: AI that creates new content such as text, images, audio, video, and code.

**Real-world Example:**

* AI in smartphones (face unlock, voice assistants like Siri/Alexa).

## 2. Machine Learning (ML)

ML enables computers to learn from past data (input-output pairs) to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

**Types of ML:**

* **Supervised Learning**: Learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., market segmentation).
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns optimal actions through trial and error (e.g., teaching a robot to walk).

**Use Cases:**

* Netflix recommendations
* Predictive maintenance in factories
* Credit scoring in banks

---

## 3. Statistical Machine Learning

Statistical ML applies mathematical and probabilistic techniques to make inferences from data.

**Examples:**

* **Linear Regression**: Predict house prices based on size.
* **Logistic Regression**: Predict if an email is spam or not.
* **Decision Trees**: Classify patients based on symptoms.
* **K-means Clustering**: Group similar users on a website.

**Use Case:**

* Customer churn prediction using decision trees.

## 4. Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning models complex relationships using multi-layered neural networks.

**Key Architectures:**

* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Basic form of DL, useful in tabular data analysis.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Specialized in processing image data.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Designed to process sequences (e.g., time series or sentences).
* **Transformers**: Advanced models for NLP; used in ChatGPT, BERT, etc.

**Use Cases:**

* Self-driving cars (CNNs for vision)
* Language translation (RNN/Transformer)
* Fraud detection

---

## 5. How ML Works

ML algorithms are trained using historical data where both input and correct output are known. It learns patterns and logic that map inputs to outputs. The trained model is then used to make predictions on new data.

**Example:**

* Given past data of housing prices, the model learns that more square footage increases price.

## 6. Classification and Regression

* **Classification**: Predict categorical outcomes.

  * **Binary**: Fraud/Not Fraud, Yes/No
  * **Multiclass**: Recognize digits 0-9 from handwritten images

* **Regression**: Predict continuous values.

  * **Linear Regression**: Predict stock prices.
  * **Logistic Regression**: Used in classification.

**Real-life Example:**

* Loan approval prediction: classification
* Predicting monthly sales: regression

## 7. Supervised vs Unsupervised ML

| Feature  | Supervised Learning              | Unsupervised Learning                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Data     | Labeled                          | Unlabeled                              |
| Examples | Classification, Regression       | Clustering                             |
| Use Case | Credit scoring, sales prediction | Market segmentation, anomaly detection |

**Outliers:**

* Data points that deviate significantly from other observations.
* Example: Fraudulent transaction in banking.

---

## 8. Structured vs Unstructured Data

* **Structured Data**: Organized in rows and columns.

  * Example: Excel sheets, relational databases (SQL).
* **Unstructured Data**: No predefined format.

  * Example: Emails, images, videos, PDF documents.

**Use Case:**

* Structured: Sales analysis in spreadsheets.
* Unstructured: Social media monitoring using NLP.

---

## 9. Image Detection & ANN

Image detection tasks (e.g., face recognition, object detection) are often handled using CNNs.

**ANN Architecture:**

* **Input Layer**: Raw data (e.g., pixel values of an image)
* **Hidden Layers**: Series of transformations
* **Output Layer**: Final prediction

**Training Method:**

* **Backpropagation**: Adjusts weights based on prediction error.

**Example:**

* Google Photos identifying people in pictures using ANN/CNN.

## 10. Statistical ML vs Deep Learning

| Parameter           | Statistical ML  | Deep Learning          |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
